why the java.utils.linkedlist.java is not widely used in huge applications

The `java.util.LinkedList` is not widely used in large-scale applications due to its **performance limitations** compared to other data structures like `ArrayList` or `ArrayDeque`. Below are the main reasons:

### 1. **Inefficient Access Times**
   - **Random Access**: Accessing elements by index in a `LinkedList` is slow ($$O(n)$$) because it requires traversing nodes sequentially. In contrast, `ArrayList` provides constant-time ($$O(1)$$) access due to its contiguous memory layout[1][3][8].
   - This makes `LinkedList` unsuitable for applications requiring frequent lookups or random access.

### 2. **Poor Cache Performance**
   - Modern processors are optimized for **cache locality**, which benefits arrays (`ArrayList`) as their elements are stored contiguously in memory. In contrast, `LinkedList` nodes are scattered, leading to frequent **cache misses** and slower performance[2][4][7].

### 3. **Memory Overhead**
   - Each node in a `LinkedList` stores both data and references (pointers) to the next and previous nodes, consuming more memory compared to an array-based structure like `ArrayList`[7][8].

### 4. **Insertion and Deletion Limitations**
   - While `LinkedList` is theoretically better for frequent insertions or deletions in the middle of the list ($$O(1)$$), this advantage is often negated by practical inefficiencies such as poor cache performance and traversal overhead[5][6].

### 5. **Specialized Alternatives**
   - For use cases like queues or stacks, specialized classes like `ArrayDeque` outperform `LinkedList` due to better memory management and performance[3][7]. 

In summary, while `LinkedList` has specific advantages (e.g., efficient sequential insertions/deletions), its drawbacks in terms of access time, memory usage, and cache inefficiency make it less suitable for large-scale applications.
